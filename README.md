## To Run
Run 'Main Page v2.html' in your browser using the Live Server extension from VS Code. Other pages run off of that main one. Note that only the Home Page and Resources Page buttons work currently. Since there are no alerts currently in washington, go to line 54 of 'NaturalDisasterAlert.js' and uncomment it to test the alert system.
